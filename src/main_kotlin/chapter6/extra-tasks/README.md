## 1. General App Development Topics (Difficulty: Easy)

**Task:**  
Write a function that takes a list of usernames (Strings) and checks if each name is at least 5 characters long. For each name, print a message (“Name is valid” or “Name is too short”). Use a loop and if-statements.

*Concepts to use:*
- Basic Types and Variables
- Functions (with parameters and return value)
- Control Flow (for-loop, if/else)

## 2. Social Messaging App (Difficulty: Medium)

**Task:**  
Create a class `Message` with properties for sender, receiver, and message content. Implement getters and setters for the message content so that it can never be empty (empty strings are not allowed). Also, write a function that takes a list of messages and prints all messages from a specific sender.

*Concepts to use:*
- Classes and Objects
- Getter and Setter
- Functions
- Control Flow (for-loop, if-statement)

## 3. FinTech App (Difficulty: Medium)

**Task:**  
Implement a class `BankAccount` with properties for account number and balance. Create a subclass `SavingsAccount` that adds an interest rate property. Write a function that checks a list of accounts and prints a warning if any balance is below 100 euros.

*Concepts to use:*
- Classes and Objects
- Subclasses and Superclasses (Inheritance)
- Functions
- Control Flow (for-loop, if-statement)

---

## 4. LLM App (Large Language Model App) (Difficulty: Hard)

**Task:**  
Define an interface `Promptable` with a function `generatePrompt(): String`. Implement two classes, `ChatBot` and `Assistant`, that implement this interface with their own versions of `generatePrompt()`. Write a function that iterates over a list of `Promptable` objects and prints the generated prompt for each.

*Concepts to use:*
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces (Polymorphism)
- Classes and Objects
- Functions
- Control Flow (for-loop)

---

## 5. Event App (Difficulty: Medium)

**Task:**  
Create a class `Event` with properties for title, date, and number of participants. Implement getters and setters for the number of participants so that it can never be negative. Write a function that takes a list of events and prints a special message for events with more than 100 participants.

*Concepts to use:*
- Classes and Objects
- Getter and Setter
- Functions
- Control Flow (for-loop, if-statement)

---

## 6. Music App (like Spotify) (Difficulty: Hard)

**Task:**  
Create a class `Track` with properties for title, artist, and duration (in seconds). Define a superclass `PlaylistItem` and let `Track` inherit from it. Write a function that takes a list of `PlaylistItem` objects and prints a special message for tracks longer than 300 seconds (“Long Track”). Use when or if-statements.

*Concepts to use:*
- Classes and Objects
- Subclasses and Superclasses (Inheritance)
- Functions
- Control Flow (for-loop, when/if)

---

Each task ensures that Control Flow, Functions, and Getters/Setters (where required) are explicitly applied. The tasks are designed to be solvable with basic to advanced Kotlin knowledge and have a clear connection to the specified app development domain.
